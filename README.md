## Important Notes

- Ensure your GitHub token has appropriate scopes for the repositories you want to query.
- The tool paginates results to handle large repos but may take time if the repository has many PRs.
- Date comparisons are inclusive of the from and to dates.
- This tool is designed as a reporting utility and not for continuous real-time monitoring.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No PRs returned in date range** \
Double-check your date formats and repository URL. Also, verify the token permissions.
